cmds
====

A simple script for changing things some things on a Mac

These are the things that it can do right now:
1. Show/Hide Hidden Folders
2. Change Terminal Colors
3. Change vim Colors
4. Run Maintenance Scripts
5. Enable/Disable Root User
6. Make shell file executable
7. Enable/Disable download warning for applications
8. Show Active Network Connections
9. 2D/3D Dock Change (Mountain Lion and earlier only)
0. Exit

The cmds folder needs to be in the home directory in order to work properly.
This is a work in progress; I add things from time to time as I find things
that are helpful. Right now the different functions look and work a little
different, but work none the less. I take no responsiblity for anything that
happens to your device that this is used on, use at your own risk. Please
contribute other funtions or comment on what you would like to see.
